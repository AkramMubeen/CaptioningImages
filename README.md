# Image Captioning using Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for implementing an image captioning model using neural networks. The model is based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), utilizing the InceptionV3 architecture for image feature extraction. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset to generate descriptive captions for images.

## Introduction

Image captioning involves generating a natural language description for an image. This repository demonstrates the process of creating an image captioning model using deep learning techniques. The model combines image features extracted from the InceptionV3 CNN with sequential information processed by an LSTM network.

## Setup

To run this code, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib Pillow keras
```

Additionally, download the pre-trained InceptionV3 model and the GloVe word vectors (glove.6B.200d.txt) and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used for training and testing is the Flickr8k dataset. The preprocessing steps involve loading image descriptions, cleaning text data, and encoding images. Descriptions are tokenized, and unnecessary information such as punctuation, numbers, and short words are removed. Images are encoded using the InceptionV3 model, and the resulting features are saved to disk.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of an InceptionV3-based CNN for image feature extraction, combined with an LSTM for sequential processing of captions. The model is trained using a combination of image features and caption sequences. Word embeddings from GloVe are used to initialize the embedding layer of the LSTM. The model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words.

## Training

The model is trained using a data generator that dynamically loads batches of image features and caption sequences during training. The training process involves optimizing the model's weights using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Training can be customized by adjusting parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size.

## Testing

After training, the model can be used to generate captions for new images. The testing process involves encoding test images and using the trained model to predict captions. The `imageSearch` function takes an encoded image as input and generates a descriptive caption using the trained model.

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated based on the generated captions for test images. Results are visualized by displaying images along with their predicted captions. The trained model can be saved for future use.

## Future Work

Possible improvements and extensions to this project include:

- Fine-tuning the model to improve performance.
- Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Incorporating attention mechanisms for better caption generation.
- Handling a larger and more diverse dataset.
